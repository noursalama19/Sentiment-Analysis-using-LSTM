# Sentiment Analysis using LSTM

## Overview

This project implements a Sentiment Analysis system using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network.
The model is designed to classify text data — such as product reviews, tweets, or comments — into sentiment categories (e.g., positive, negative, neutral).

The project demonstrates how deep learning techniques, particularly Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and LSTM cells, can effectively handle sequential data for natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

## Features
Text preprocessing: tokenization, padding, and cleaning.

LSTM-based deep learning model for sentiment classification.

Model training and evaluation with accuracy metrics.

Visualization of training/validation loss and accuracy.

Easy to extend for other text classification tasks.

## Technologies Used
Python 3.x

TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the implementation)

Keras (for high-level model building)

scikit-learn (for data processing and evaluation)

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

NLTK / spaCy (for optional text preprocessing)


## Dataset
A sample dataset (e.g., IMDB movie reviews or a custom dataset) is used.

Data must include at least two columns: text and label.

Note: If you wish to use a different dataset, ensure it is properly formatted and adjust the preprocessing.py script if needed.




##Future Improvements
Fine-tuning hyperparameters for better accuracy.

Implementing a bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) for improved performance.

Adding attention mechanism for more focus on key parts of the text.
